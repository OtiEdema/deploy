Summary
A combination of data simulation, statistical analysis, visualization, and strategic interpretation techniques, all of which contributed to a comprehensive solution with a tangible business impact.


Solution
The application of these techniques resulted in a project that not only demystifies the patterns of audience engagement but also provides actionable guidance to enhance content strategy and drive business growth through social media platforms.  


Approach
Pandas used to generate a dataset of simulated 'Likes' across various categories. Pandas used to cleaned the dataset by removing any nulls or duplicates. Seaborn and Matplotlib to plot the distribution of 'Likes'. Boxplots to compare the range and median of 'Likes' across different categories, identifying outliers and patterns of engagement.  Calculated the mean 'Likes' for each category and overall, providing a metric for comparison and identifying high and low-performing segments.
